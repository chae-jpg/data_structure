# Code 1
- Introduction 
This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of both a standard selection sort and a stable selection sort. The program uses a simple data structure to hold pairs of IDs and scores and sorts them based on the score in ascending order.

- How to Run the Code
You can just open this file with your IDE, and run it.

- How to Adjust Parameters
If you want to change the input for the sorting, you can change the values in `data_id` and `data_score` arrays to represent your own dataset.

# Code 2
- Introduction
This C program implements the Radix Sort algorithm to efficiently sort an array of randomly generated 24-bit integers. Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. The implementation here specifically handles 24-bit integers, breaking them down into four 6-bit digits.

- How to Run the Code
You can just open the file with your ide and run it.
- How to Adjust Parameters
If you want to change the size of the array, you can change it by changing the value of ARR_SIZE.
And also you can change the digit of the number by changing the value of DIGIT variable.
