# Code 2
- Introduction
This is the code that finds the successor of the given tree. tree_predecesor function finds the successor of the given node and return it. Then, while there is no more successor in the tree, the successor of the node is kept printed.
- How to run the code
You can just open this file with your IDE, and run it.
- How to adjust parameters
If you want to change the tree, then you can fix it from the top part of the code that tree is assigned. And also in this code, since the parent of the tree is previously declared in function, you must also modify the parent of each node in main if there is a difference.

# Code 3

- How to adjust parameters
If you want to change the tree, then you can fix it from the top part of the code that tree is assigned. (from line 19 to 30) And if you want to change the node to be deleted, you can change it by changing the argument of delete_node function in main function.
