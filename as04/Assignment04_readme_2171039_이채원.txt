# Code 1
- Introduction

- How to run the code
You can just open this file with your IDE, and run it.
- How to adjust parameters

# Code 2
- Introduction
This is the modified version of Simulation.cpp with two staffs. To make clear that which staff accepted the customer, a message which tells that the staff accepted the customer is added. And without the main function, other parts of the code is same with the original code.
- How to run the code
You can just open this file with your IDE, and run it.
- How to adjust parameters
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE and duration parameters are set 10 times bigger than the original code to see that how two staffs are more powerful than a single staff. So if you want to change these parameters, you can just fix it in the code. Other parmeters like arrival probabilty of the customers or maximum serve time also could be changed.
